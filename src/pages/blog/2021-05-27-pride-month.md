Pride is a time to celebrate queer resistance, culture and community. QueerLand is offering several free programs this month that do exactly that! RSVP via our [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/queerland-32889686413)! 



**1. Angelic Troublemakers: Bayard Rustin and the Principles of Nonviolent Resistance**

**Wednesday June 9th, 6pm PT** 

Bayard Rustin was an activist in various movements for human rights for over 50 years. While he played a major role in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, mentoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and organizing the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, his contributions were marginalized for decades because he was an openly and unapolegetically gay man.\
\
This workshop will examine Rustin's work and the influence of his theory of nonviolent resistance, which grew out of his religious pacifism and of which he was among the earliest American practitioners, decades before the concept became famously associated with Dr. King. We will explore Rustin's work and philosophy by reading and discussing some short examples of his writing and in particular focusing on perhaps his most famous quotation:\
\
"We need, in every community, a group of angelic troublemakers. Our power is in our ability to make things unworkable. The only weapon we have is our bodies. And we need to tuck them into places so that wheels don't turn."
