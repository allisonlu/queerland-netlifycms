Queerland is an arts-focused youth community center centered on empowering LGBTQIA+ youth by providing life-changing opportunities for queer youth to train in the arts , learn about queer culture through our archive of LGBTQIA+ works and Q&A panels with queer creators, provide opportunities for them to perform or showcase their craft, participate in wraparound wellness activities and programs, and have a space to connect with the queer community through arts-oriented social events.
