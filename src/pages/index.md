Here in QueerLand, we are building a better world for the LGBTQIA+ community by uplifting and educating our next generations youth through the celebration and creation of LGBTQIA+ culture. QueerLand, a nonprofit youth community center based in Los Angeles, exists to empower and provide LGBTQIA+ youth (ages 14-25) with a restorative space that celebrates queer culture and offers opportunities to learn artistic crafts, perform and showcase their craft, participate in wrap-around wellness programs, and connect with their queer community in a sober space. 

Check out our past and future events on our instagram and facebook, @queerland.center! Feel free to contact us via email at queerland@protonmail.com with any questions! \

**There are few places today where one can exist in safety and comfort (especially as a queer person) without spending money- the QueerLand Community Center will be one of those few remaining safe havens in Los Angeles. Please help us make this possible by donating today!**\
