Are you LGBTQ+ and looking to make friends around LA? QueerLand & Via Care LA bring you "LGBTQ+ Speed Friending"!! . We'll have crafts, queer bingo (with prizes!), snacks, and the opportunity to make lifelong queer friends!

ViaCare LA is lovingly providing HIV and STI resources, making it even easier for our community to stay healthy!

Speaking of community health, we do have COVID-19 precautions in place to keep everyone safe. Please bring your masks and proof of vaccination for entry to this event.

Stay updated about upcoming free events by following us @queerland.center on all platforms and @vialgbtqcare on Instagram!
