QueerLand is hosting another open mic @spokeandwealla! !! Join us August 29th at 6:30pm for a night of spoken word, music, and comedy. All attendees are welcome to perform :) 

MAJOR thank you to @spokeandweal for offering up their space to us again, we so appreciate the home they provide to us <3

 We had over 40 attendees at our last open mic, so be sure to reserve your ticket now!
