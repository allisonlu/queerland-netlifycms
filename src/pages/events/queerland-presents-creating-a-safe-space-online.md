Join us Friday April 30th @ 5:30pm to discuss creating your own safe space and platform and chat with other Queer youth!

At this workshop, you will learn how to create spaces for yourself and your community. Our host will guide you through designing social media platforms for the LGBTQ+ youth and community.

Hosted by: Maia (she/they), a 22-year-old black trans woman who wants to help reach out to the LGBTQ+ community, especially the youth in the community.
