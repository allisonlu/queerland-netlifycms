**Join QueerLand for an evening of poetry and LGBTQ+ support led by social worker and poet Johnny Valera!**

## About this event

🏳️‍🌈We'll be exploring several poetry pieces and dissecting the feelings that might have motivated each piece with the idea that through exploring the works of others, we'll further our ability to put our own feelings into words. We'll explore these feelings further in our second meeting, next month, when we'll write our own poems.

🏳️‍🌈Johnny Valera (Pronouns: He/Him/They/Them) is a fat, queer, Latinx, social worker and writer living in the greater Los Angeles area. Growing up in East Los Angeles, Johnny found significant influence from his community and family, particularly from the matriarchs in his childhood including his grandmother, mother, and aunt, whom inspired and cultivated his own exploration of identity. Having facilitated and created a curriculum Writing for Recovery, he encourages everyone to utilize the power of writing to find the tools they need for change.
